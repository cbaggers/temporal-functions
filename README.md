==================

Rewrite of the temporal function code from cepl.

Adds tlambda, tdefun & tdefvar along with a pile of related funcs and macros



Background
----------

I had spent an afternoon reading about and sketching out different ways obstracting time. My mind must have been working on something without my input as I suddenly heard the words "Temporal Lambda" in my head.

The 'voice' stopped me in my tracks and I started wondering what temporal lambdas were...or what they could be. The idea of temporal scope sounded weird too. I decided the only way to resolve this way to build the constructs and see if they turn out to be useful.

Use will prove this useful or delusional :)
